# GoAuthServer

## About
This is a sample project that I have created to learn more about the Go programming language and the Gin web framework.

The project is a simple REST API which allows the users to read and add to a collection of albums. Some features include:
* Multiple authentication/authorization schemes to support SPAs and non-web applications
* Repository design pattern
* Communication with a MySQL web server

## Notes
* This project originally started as I was following the tutorial here: https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin. I decided to build on top of that tutorial in order to learn about some features I'd be interested in using the future (JWT auth, db communication, etc)
* Feel free to use this project as a reference/as a basis for your own project, but note that this project is being developed as an exercise and that there will likely be more complete tutorial resources out there
